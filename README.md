Implemented faster variants of 8-Queens and Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm as part of Artificial Intelligence course.

1. Used local search optimization to select best child out of all possible children for better reproduction in future generations.
2. Used double mutation for to bring about population diversity, avoiding local minima.

Modified version 50x faster than original genetic algorithm, achieving optimum answer faster an in fewer generations.
